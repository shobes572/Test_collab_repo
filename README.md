What's Streamin'

What's Streamin' is an interactive front end web application that can be utilized when a user wants to know which streaming applications a particular movie is available for viewing on. When the user enters a movie title into the search field, the user is then directed to a results page with a list of movie cards which display the movie poster, title, release date, rating, and summary. The user can then click on a movie title card and be presented with the streaming application and URL link for the streaming service that the movie is currently streaming on for viewing purposes.
